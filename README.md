üìå Project Overview
The HR Management System is a full-stack application I developed to manage personnel, inventory, and assignment operations with secure authentication and real-time notifications.

The system includes:
Personnel Management ‚Äì Add, update, filter, and view detailed employee records with profile photos.

Inventory Management ‚Äì Track company assets, manage their status, and update inventory information.

Assignment Operations ‚Äì Assign inventory to employees, track return dates, and manage asset handovers.

Authentication & Authorization ‚Äì Role-based access control using JWT + Refresh Token.

Real-time Notifications ‚Äì Implemented via WebSocket (STOMP) for instant updates.

Centralized Logging ‚Äì Integrated ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for professional log management.

This project follows best practices in layered architecture, uses RESTful APIs for backend communication, and is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

üåç Environment Variables
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/hr
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=postgres
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=604800000
LOGSTASH_HOST=logstash
LOGSTASH_PORT=5000

üìä Logging (ELK)
Logback sends logs to Logstash via TCP (5000 port).

Logstash processes logs and sends them to Elasticsearch.

Kibana visualizes logs with index pattern: hr-logs-*.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The project does not come with a full Docker setup.
Only Elasticsearch and Kibana are provided via Docker.
Please run the backend and frontend locally to start the application.
